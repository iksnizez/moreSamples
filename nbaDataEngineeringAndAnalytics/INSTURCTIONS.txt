Instructions:

Open the R project in the home git directory.

- In /script/
	- DataExploration is just a file I used to poke around the raw data. It is not needed for the workflow
	- etl.r will retrieve the files from saved location, process them and import the data to the 3 tables in the db
		input:
			- 3 json files
		output:
			- 3 populated DB tables with the same name as the json files

- In Output
	- creatingModelDataSet.rmd 
		input: 
			database populated by etl.r file. It does some additional data prep to prepare it for modeling. 
		output: 
			2 files into the output folder that will be used by ModelTrainingPrediction to train a model 
			and predict NBA talent for the latest international class of players
			- international_train_data.csv
			- internation_test_data.csv


	- modelTrainingPrediction.rmd will ingest data from the 2 output files and output predictions
	for players in the lastest international class making the NBA
		input:
			- international_train_data.csv
			- internation_test_data.csv
		output:
			-target_players.csv   (this is sorted by strongest prospect to worst)


The workflow would be etl.r > creatingModelDataSet.rmd > modelTrainingPrediction.rmd > output:data:target_players.csv
